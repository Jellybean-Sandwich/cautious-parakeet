uBlock Origins filters for Youtube

# What this does:
Blocks irritating and disruptive elements of Youtube. 

Currently, blocked elements are:
<br />End cards, 
<br />the 'old browser' alert, 
<br />the "Sign In for the Best Youtube Experience" screen, 
<br />the Up Next section, 
<br />comments, 
<br />and the 'People Also Watched' section inside searches

A lite version that doesn't block comments, 'People Also Watched', and 'Up Next', is also available

# How to use this:
<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/Jellybean-Sandwich/cautious-parakeet/releases/latest">cautious-parakeet_ublock-filters-for-youtube.txt</a>
<br />Open the uBlock Origins dashboard
<br />Navigate to 'My Filters', press 'Import and Append' and choose the txt file you downloaded
<br />Press 'Apply Changes'
<br /> All done!</p>
